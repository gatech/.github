## Georgia Tech GitHub

This organization hosts open source projects from the Georgia Institute of Technology that have wide usage and impact both in their userbase and community.

For public open source projects from the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI), please see [https://github.com/gtri](https://github.com/gtri).

Many research groups and labs will have their own public GitHub organizations and repositories; there is no central directory of Georgia Tech open source projects or a requirement to publish open source code in this Georgia Tech public organization. However, if you would like explore or contribute to our growing list of Georgia Tech open source projects, please see the [OSS Project Explorer site](https://gt-ospo.github.io/oss-project-explorer/), maintained by Georgia Tech's [Open Source Program Office](https://ospo.cc.gatech.edu/)
